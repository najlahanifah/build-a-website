                   <p class="banner-p"> According to Evliya Ã‡elebi, the city was initially called Dohuk-e Dasinya, named after the militant and strong Dasini tribe who were believers of Yazidism. 
                     The Yazidi population is still relatively significant, but has decreased due to persecution. This made it possible for Muslims, Christians and Jews to settle in the town.
                     n 1929, the city had a population of 3,500 people, of which a majority was Kurdish. Out of the 550 families, 65 were Christian and 30 were Jewish. The city also housed Tyari 
                     and Chaldean refugees from Turkey.
